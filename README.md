# homeowners-prediction-model
Final assignment for CMPUT 175.  Analyzed homeowners financial data and generated graphs using matplotlib. Trained a prediction model to predict the loan status of homeowners based on filtered data using scikit-learn. Utilized a smooth, carousel-based interface for easy navigation of predictions, built using a circular linked-list.
